This directory will contain modular documents (≤200 lines each) for preliminaries, Hilbert space, Hamiltonians, properties, and diagrammatic calculus. Use `_overview.md` files in subdirectories to aid navigation and keep concepts separated.

**New in §11:** Matrix element computations for 2-local operators on hard-core sectors.
