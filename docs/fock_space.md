# 3.2 Fock Space Perspective (First Quantisation)

## 3.2.1 Standard Fock space as direct sum of n-particle spaces

The standard Fock space $\mathcal{F}$ is defined as a direct sum of $n$-particle Hilbert spaces:
$$ \mathcal{F} = \bigoplus_{N=0}^{\infty} \mathcal{H}_N $$
where $\mathcal{H}_N$ is the $N$-particle Hilbert space. In our first-quantised approach, creation and annihilation operators are not used.

## 3.2.2 Direct sum as "OR quantifier" (superposition of particle numbers)

The direct sum in the Fock space can be interpreted as an "OR quantifier", representing a superposition of states with different particle numbers. This means that a state in Fock space can be in a superposition of having 0 particles OR 1 particle OR 2 particles, and so on. This is distinct from the tensor product, which represents an "AND quantifier" for multiple particles or sites (see §3.2.3).

This interpretation is discussed in [arXiv:1910.10619, §2]. `[unverified]`
