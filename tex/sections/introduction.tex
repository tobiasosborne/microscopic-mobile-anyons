\subsection{Why Mobile Anyons?}
\label{sec:why-mobile-anyons}

Anyonic particles---quasiparticle excitations obeying exotic exchange statistics that interpolate between bosonic and fermionic behaviour---have become central objects of study in condensed matter physics and quantum information theory. The mathematical framework of fusion categories provides a rigorous foundation for describing systems of anyons, encoding their fusion rules, braiding statistics, and algebraic structure in a unified formalism~\cite{Kitaev2006,ENO2005}.

Existing microscopic many-body models based on fusion categories, such as the celebrated golden chain~\cite{Feiguin2007}, describe systems where anyons occupy fixed positions on a lattice. In such models, the number of anyons is constant and their positions are predetermined---analogous to the tightly-packed Mott insulating phase in condensed matter systems. While these models have yielded profound insights into anyonic physics, including connections to conformal field theory at criticality, they represent only a special limiting case of the broader landscape of possible anyonic phases.

In realistic physical systems, however, particle number and position are typically dynamical degrees of freedom. Electrons in metals move freely through the lattice; ultracold atoms in optical lattices tunnel between sites; quasiparticles in quantum Hall systems can be created, annihilated, and transported. A complete understanding of anyonic matter requires extending the categorical framework to accommodate such \emph{mobile} or \emph{itinerant} anyons.

The motivation for developing microscopic models of mobile anyons is threefold:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item \textbf{Connection to realistic physics.} Physical systems supporting anyonic excitations---such as fractional quantum Hall states or topological superconductors---generically allow for variable anyon number and mobility. Microscopic models capturing these features would bridge the gap between abstract categorical data and experimentally accessible phenomena including transport, scattering, and thermodynamic properties.

    \item \textbf{Exploration of new phases.} Beyond the Mott-like limit of fixed anyons, one expects a rich phase diagram including dilute anyonic gases, anyonic superfluids, and intermediate correlated phases. The interplay between anyonic exchange statistics and spatial dynamics may give rise to novel collective phenomena without analogue in conventional bosonic or fermionic systems.

    \item \textbf{Recovery of known limits.} A consistent framework must reproduce well-understood special cases. When fusion rules are trivial ($X \otimes X = \one$), we should recover ordinary bosons or fermions depending on the braiding structure. For super-vector spaces (sVec), the construction should reduce exactly to fermionic Fock space with standard anticommutation relations. For dense configurations, we should recover the physics of the golden chain and related models.
\end{enumerate}

The present work addresses this gap by developing a systematic framework for constructing microscopic lattice models describing mobile anyons arising from an arbitrary fusion category. Working in a first-quantised formalism on a one-dimensional chain with open boundary conditions, we construct Hilbert spaces that accommodate variable anyon number and anyon mobility, and define microscopic Hamiltonians for physically motivated scenarios.
