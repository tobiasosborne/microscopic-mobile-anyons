# proofs Overview

| ID | Assumption | Type | Status |
|----|------------|------|--------|
| A1 | Proofs follow Lamport-style hierarchical protocol from AGENTS.md | Technical | assumed |

Store Lamport-structured proofs and subproofs here, one result per file. Keep proofs basis-independent where possible and cite sources with `[unverified]` until HITL verification.
