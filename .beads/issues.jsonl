However, Lambda is defined as a set of dimensionless site indices (0 to n-1) in Assumption A4.1.2, while elsewhere x_j are referred to as physical positions with units of length (e.g., in §4.1.3, which defines x_j = epsilon * j). This creates an inconsistency. The definition needs to be clarified to distinguish between site indices and physical positions, or Lambda must be consistently defined. Planning ref: §4.1.1.
