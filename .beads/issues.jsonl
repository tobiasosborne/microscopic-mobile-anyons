{"id":"microscopic-mobile-anyons-5mv","title":"Explicit treatment of associativity patterns in morphism spaces","description":"Planning ref: Critical/Epic for §3.1 onwards.\n\nISSUE: The morphism spaces as abstract vector spaces are isomorphic regardless of bracketing (Mac Lane coherence). However, when we work with concrete operators and states, we need to commit to a specific associativity pattern.\n\nTwo approaches:\n1. **Fusion trees**: Fix a canonical binary bracketing and label internal edges\n2. **Explicit tensor bracketing**: Write out parentheses explicitly in tensor products\n\nREQUIREMENT: This distinction must be explicitly pointed out from the introduction of fusion categories (§3.1) onward, and carried through consistently in:\n- Definition of morphism spaces (§3.1.3)\n- F-symbols and associators (§3.1.4)\n- Hilbert space construction (§4.2)\n- Operator definitions (§4.3)\n\nACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:\n1. Early warning in fusion category section about this subtlety\n2. Clear statement of which convention we adopt (or how we handle both)\n3. Consistent notation throughout all subsequent sections\n4. Examples showing the difference in concrete calculations\n\nIMPACT: Affects all sections from §3.1 onward.
